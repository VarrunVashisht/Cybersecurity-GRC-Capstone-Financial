# Control Framework Strategy  
**Organization:** FinTrust Capital

## 1. Objective
To establish a unified control framework that satisfies multiple  
regulatory and industry standards while reducing duplication  
and audit fatigue.

## 2. Primary Framework
- **NIST SP 800-53** – Security and Privacy Controls

## 3. Secondary Frameworks
- **ISO/IEC 27001** – Information Security Management  
- **PCI DSS** – Payment Card Security  
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework** – Program-level alignment

## 4. Mapping Approach
- NIST SP 800-53 is used as the baseline control set.
- Other frameworks are mapped to NIST controls to ensure:
  - Consistent implementation
  - Standardized reporting

## 5. Benefits
- Single source of truth for controls
- Simplified audits
- Consistent risk reporting
- Improved regulatory confidence
